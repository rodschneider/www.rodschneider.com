# About Me

Since 1998, I’ve been navigating the dynamic landscape of technology, evolving from a junior full-stack Java developer to a Senior Solution Architect and IT Strategist.

My 26-year career blends technical expertise, a passion for innovation, and a knack for making complex systems approachable, with a touch of humour to keep things human. Over the past decade, I’ve embraced cloud-native, and API-first technologies — Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Boot and Kafka — crafting scalable, resilient enterprise solutions that deliver results.  I'm passionate about incorporating AI analysis and insights into my solutions to improve customer journeys and experiences.

Although I loved coding on my Commodore 64 in the early 80s and tinkering with Slackware Linux on my 486 DX2 66 in the early 90s, my real tech adventure began in the engineering lab at university, where I designed a robotic mouse that was able to navigate and solve any maze using infrared sensors and AI—a clever piece of engineering that set the tone for my career.

In 1999, I helped code PeopleWeb, a social network and info portal for US interest groups, a precursor to modern social media.

By 2000, I created BiCamera, a wearable computer and client/server solution enabling press photographers to wirelessly upload images from their digital cameras to newsrooms, streamlining digital journalism for online news websites.

In 2002, I developed Kahootz, an online collaboration platform for Australian schoolchildren to create and share 3D animated worlds, games, and narratives, foreshadowing Minecraft and sparking creativity across classrooms.

The mid 2000s were a proving ground for enterprise solutions. In 2005, I automated billing and payment processes for Alinta Energy using the webMethods product suite, enhancing operational efficiency.

In 2006, I contributed to Telstra’s Single Customer View solution as part of their digital transformation project, mapping and migrating 18 million customer records into new CRM and billing systems—a logistical feat.

By 2008, I architected Intrepid Travel’s online booking system, evaluated Powercor’s smart meter architecture, and secured a $5.3M bid for Victoria’s Department of Transport to track train timetables with precision.

In 2010, I designed systems for Victoria’s Department of Justice, including online health records, prisoner tracking and real-time facial recognition, blending innovation with practical impact.

The 2010s marked my shift to cloud, mobile-first and API-first technologies. At Australia Post (2012), I designed RESTful Java APIs and services for Digital Mailbox onboarding, laying the groundwork for my cloud expertise. At CGU (2012–2014), I contributed to the architecture for a core system replacement, integrating cloud-based and on-premise services with WebSphere and Informatica Cloud, delivering modern insurance platforms including an iPhone app for mobile travel insurance claims. At Landmark (2014–2015), I crafted application designs during their transition from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS cloud, aligning with Agrium’s global IT strategy while working with SAP, Hybris Commerce, and early containerisation concepts.

In 2015, at Vision Australia, I led a MuleSoft integration team for a NetSuite ERP and Salesfore CRM implementation, designing REST APIs and data flows to connect core systems, refining my integration skills. At Ruah Tech Solutions (2018–2020), I focused on designing web applications and mobile CRM solutions with complex data integrations, streamlining development and deployment. My focus on AI deepened at Comet Suite (2022–2023), where, as Interim General Manager, I led remote teams across Australia, the USA, and the Philippines to deliver AI prospecting, lead generation and sales automation solutions.

At Insiteful (2023–2024), as Chief Operating Officer, I mentored teams and optimised operations, focusing on eCommerce tech for Australian retailers.  Now at Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions, I'm providing technical leadership for 7-Eleven Australia's POS replacement project, orchestrating microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Boot, and Azure. My "hands-on" approach — whether coding a fix, designing event-driven architectures with Kafka, sketching solutions or writing design briefs — differentiates me from other IT leaders.

Collaboration is central to my work. I’ve mentored developers, led cross-functional teams, and earned LinkedIn endorsements for innovation and teamwork. As a dev.to contributor, I share insights on Docker, Kubernetes, micro-services and AI, breaking down cloud-native concepts with clarity. My career has spanned floppy disks to cloud clusters, with my pivot to cloud-native tools defining my recent work, enabling me to build systems that scale seamlessly.

From pioneering wearable tech to architecting enterprise cloud solutions, I’m driven by problem-solving and a love for learning. Whether optimizing Kubernetes clusters, designing Kafka streams, or guiding teams, I approach challenges with curiosity and precision. As I shape the future of enterprise technology, I bring experience, a collaborative spirit, and a hint of humor to keep things lively. Need a mobile-first, API-first, cloud-native architect? I’m your guy — please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
